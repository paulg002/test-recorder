# Test recorder

Test recorder is a Chrome developer tool that records user interaction within a web application and generates Cypress scripts to allow the developer to replicate that particular session. This will speed up your development cycle by facilitating the creation of end-to-end tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

## Getting Started

Download Test recorder from the [Chrome Web Store]. That's it! Once you see our icon at the upper-right of your browser window, you are ready to start generating Cypress scripts.

## Features

This extension will allow you to:

* Record clicks, typing, submits, and navigation in the browser.
* See the scripts render live as they are generated.
* Delete accidental actions.
* Reorder actions as necessary.
* Pause and resume recording within a single session.
* Record navigation within a superdomain.
* Copy the generated code to your clipboard.


## Usage

* Open the extension and click 'Start Recording' to begin recording actions.
* Click links, submit forms, etc.
* Check your saved actions by opening the popup at any time. To check recording status at a glance, note our icon: if recording, it will look like this: ![cypressconeREC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22487388/67896806-5973e600-fb1a-11e9-8ee8-87b1e8338e3e.png)
* Click 'Stop Recording' to stop recording. From there, you will have the option to resume recording, reset, or copy your generated code to your clipboard.
* You can also use keyboard shortcuts:
    On Macs:
    - Ctrl + R to start and stop recording
    - Ctrl + G to reset
    
    On PCs and Linux:
    - Alt + R to start and stop recording
    - Alt + G to reset
